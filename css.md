For my final year at University of Bristol, I held the position of Outreach Officer&mdash;and, from September to December 2018, of Acting Press Officer&mdash;on the CSS committee. In my role I coordinated with University of Bristol, local schools and external organisations to increase STEM engagement and managed branding, publicity and social media presence for the 2.1k+ member society.

The society organises events for students including tech talks, socials, hands-on activities, "capture the flag" events and hackathons, many in collaboration with local and multinational companies. These events have an average attendance of roughly 100 students, including members from other disciplines.

Explore Week is an untimetabled week in the middle of the semester which students are encouraged to utilise to pursue or explore their STEM interests. CSS organises a number of events during this week, including an Industry Panel, 24-hour Game Jam, Lightning Talks from academics and a coursework support afternoon (CodeLounge).

MVBall is one of the highlights of the CSS calendar: an opportunity for students to unwind and enjoy an evening of fine food, wine and dancing at the end of the semester. CSS also arranges a number of socials before the Christmas holiday, and engages with international events such as Google Hash Code.

Another highlight of the year is the annual CSS Hackathon sponsored by The Boeing Company. In 2019, the theme was 'Wellbeing', with students creating apps and services supporting mental health, applications for AR technology in unsafe environments and performing original data science research.

In 2018/19, University of Bristol Computer Science Society's Gold Sponsors are Bloomberg, Cookpad, Dyson and Just Eat.
